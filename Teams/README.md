# Forescout and Teams
Using the Forescout Open Integrations Module (OIM), this document will walk you through integrating Forescout with Microsoft Teams. Teams is a unified communications platform that combines persistent workplace chat, video meetings, file storage (including collaboration on files), and application integration.


* Post to a Team Channel
  * Similar to the Send Email action, this action will post whatever you put in the json to the Team channel you pick.  
  * Based on the json options, you will be able to create posts with hyperlinks, message actions and more. 

With this integration you gain another, real-time, notification method on top of email. The send email action does not allow for HTML, therefore sending hyperlinks is not possible. Using Teams you can immediately get alerted to policy triggers with hyperlinked actions in the channel post. Tags {tags} can be used in the json that posts into the channel as well.
