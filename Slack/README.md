# Forescout and Slack
Using the Forescout Open Integrations Module (OIM), this document will walk you through integrating Forescout with Slack. Slack is a cloud-based, team collaboration tool suite. With this integration you will gain the following:

- Post to a Slack Channel Similar to the Send Email action, this action will post whatever you put in the json to the slack channel you pick.  
- Hyperlink assets in the slack post to the Forescout Asset Portal
- Post as a direct message to a slack user

With this integration you gain another, real-time, notification method on top of email.

## Some notes:
